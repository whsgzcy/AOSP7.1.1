* **1.1 LayoutInflater.Factory2**
* **1.2 ContextThemeWrapper**

##一、什么是Activity

```
/core/java/android/app/Activity.java
```

有过Android APP开发经验的人看到代码上的注释其实是很容易理解的，就可以理解为，专注于用户交互的一个single，它可以被用作于xxx，等；

```
/**
 * An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.  Almost all
 * activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
 * creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
 * {@link #setContentView}.  While activities are often presented to the user
 * as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating
 * windows (via a theme with {@link android.R.attr#windowIsFloating} set)
 * or embedded inside of another activity (using {@link ActivityGroup}).
 *
 ...
```

如果只看开头的这段代码来说，他就是实现这些接口的回调，事件、window、组件等等，代码量很多，在此只做两点分析：

* LayoutInflater.Factory2
* ContextThemeWrapper

```
public class Activity extends ContextThemeWrapper
        implements LayoutInflater.Factory2,
        Window.Callback, KeyEvent.Callback,
        OnCreateContextMenuListener, ComponentCallbacks2,
        Window.OnWindowDismissedCallback, WindowControllerCallback
```

###1.1 LayoutInflater.Factory2

其实看到LayoutInflater，和我们平时在写view时，xml转换为view其实是一样的，它的本质还是基于一个反射机制；

实例化xml文件对应其view

```
/core/java/android/view/LayoutInflater.java
```

```
/**
 * Instantiates a layout XML file into its corresponding {@link android.view.View}
 * objects. It is never used directly. Instead, use
 * {@link android.app.Activity#getLayoutInflater()} or
 * {@link Context#getSystemService} to retrieve a standard LayoutInflater instance
 * that is already hooked up to the current context and correctly configured
 * for the device you are running on.  For example:
 *
 * <pre>LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)context.getSystemService
 *      (Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To create a new LayoutInflater with an additional {@link Factory} for your
 * own views, you can use {@link #cloneInContext} to clone an existing
 * ViewFactory, and then call {@link #setFactory} on it to include your
 * Factory.
 *
 * <p>
 * For performance reasons, view inflation relies heavily on pre-processing of
 * XML files that is done at build time. Therefore, it is not currently possible
 * to use LayoutInflater with an XmlPullParser over a plain XML file at runtime;
 * it only works with an XmlPullParser returned from a compiled resource
 * (R.<em>something</em> file.)
 *
 * @see Context#getSystemService
 */
```

那么Factory2是什么

在系统填充view前会回调该接口，你可以去自定义布局的填充（有点类似于拦截器）

使用LayoutInflater Factory的这一特性可以做很多事：

* 提高view构建的效率

当我们使用自定义view时，需要在xml中使用完整类名，系统实际就是根据完整类名进行反射构建。我们可以自己new出view避免系统反射调用，提高效率；

* 替换默认view实现，改变或添加属性

```

  public interface Factory {
        /**
         * Hook you can supply that is called when inflating from a LayoutInflater.
         * You can use this to customize the tag names available in your XML
         * layout files.
         * 
         * <p>
         * Note that it is good practice to prefix these custom names with your
         * package (i.e., com.coolcompany.apps) to avoid conflicts with system
         * names.
         *
